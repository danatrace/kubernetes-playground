The mantra behind all this is that you
> Spend **more** time **innovating** 😄⚗️ and *less* time *configuring* 😣🛠

*K8s-Playground is a 🚀 rocket launcher for enabling tutorials or workshops in an easy, fast and resource efficient way.* All tutorials can be automatized and versioned so that the student can at anytime spin the cluster and start exactly with the task at hand so he'll focus on the subject to learn without losing any time configuring trivial stuff.
